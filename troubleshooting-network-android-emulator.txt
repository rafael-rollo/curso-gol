add header 'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'

My issue was the emulator had a dns server error. 
I fixed this by appending -dns 8.8.8.8 when running the emulator command.

I dont know how far this approach is good, but for me if I go to
Tools -> AVD Manager -> Choose my device and wipe the data.

Then re-run the reac-native run-android, it seems to fetch the results perfectly without any network errors.
But it doesnt make sense why this approach works.

------

In my case I had to specify the dns-server when starting up, which allowed me internet access.

The following on Mac:

cd ~/Library/Android/sdk/tools
emulator -list-avds
Will give you a list of emulators, then you will need to start one up with the DNS specified, e.g.

emulator -avd Nexus_7_2012_API_27 -dns-server 10.1.1.1
Also, in my config I was referring to a hostname that was configured in my /etc/hosts which seems to work for iOS emulator, but I have to go with the ip address on the android one.

# this worked for me
i have https and http on my server
my IP and port constant is rejecting request for security reason
and i can't use constant IP in my URL react native because it change periodicly
i started with
https://185.85.*:8080/api .. > it closed by sysadmin
http://185.85.*/api .. > it closed by sysadmin
http://mysite.com/api .. http manual
https://mysite.com/api .. https manul
and so on ...
and i suddenly tested with
https://www.mysite.com/api .. and it worked ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
dont forget to test with WWW

I'm working with React native and Flask REST API, i had the same issue.
And i fixed it by adding:

host= '0.0.0.0'
Example:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host= '0.0.0.0')
Thanks to @jhadjar
